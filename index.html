                <p>"but what is the matter? of course i won't look at it if you don't want me to," he said, rather coldly, turning on his heel and going over towards the window. "but, really, it seems rather absurd that i shouldn't see my own work, especially
                    as i am going to exhibit it in paris in the autumn. i shall probably have to give it another coat of varnish before that, so i must see it some day, and why not to-day?"</p>

                <p>"to exhibit it! you want to exhibit it?" exclaimed dorian gray, a strange sense of terror creeping over him. was the world going to be shown his secret? were people to gape at the mystery of his life? that was impossible. something--he
                    did not know what--had to be done at once.</p>

                <p>he felt that the time had really come for making his choice. or had his choice already been made? yes, life had decided that for him--life, and his own infinite curiosity about life. eternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures subtle and
                    secret, wild joys and wilder sins--he was to have all these things. the portrait was to bear the burden of his shame: that was all.</p>
